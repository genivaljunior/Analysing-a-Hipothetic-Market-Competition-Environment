# Analysing-a-Hipothetic-Market-Competition-Environment
This project aims to evaluate an usual market situation where a set of products provided by several competitors generates many demand curves, depending on the prices and payment benefits offered by each one.  In 2 (two) files, we can observe:      The quantities sold by our company, per day and price practiced, from 2015 1st Jan to 2015 14th Oct;     The competitors's prices and payment types practiced, monitored per time (day-in), on the same dates;  There are 6 (six) competitors (C1 to C6), 9 (nine) products (P1 to P9) and 2 (two) payment types (T1: deferred payment and T2: immediate payment).  Our goals here are:  1) Produce an understanding of prices, payment methods and demand behavior; and  2) Purpose a machine learning schema to predict demanda in quantities given the prices set
